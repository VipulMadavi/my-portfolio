## ✨ Unique Features

- **🎭 Dual-Mode Interface**: Switch between a sleek "Cloud Horizon" GUI and a "Cloud Shell" Developer Terminal.
- **🛰️ Interactive Network Background**: Powered by Canvas API for a dynamic, neural-link aesthetic.
- **⚡ Ultra-Lightweight**: Built with Vanilla JS & Vite for sub-second load times.
- **📟 Hidden Terminal**: A professional CLI environment for power users.

## 📟 Accessing the Hidden Terminal Mode

The portfolio features a hidden "Developer Shell" mode. You can access it in following way:

  **URL Entry**: Append `?dev=true` or `?mode=shell` to the website URL.
    *   Example: `https://vipulmadavi.github.io/vipulm1509.github.io/?dev=true`

### ⌨️ Terminal Commands
Once inside the shell, try these commands:
- `about` — View professional summary.
- `skills` — Display technical proficiency.
- `projects` — List of security & dev projects.
- `gui` — Switch back to Graphical Mode.
- `clear` — Wipe the terminal screen.
- `help` — Show all available commands.

## 💡 A Note on Build Process

While I used AI to speed up some of the repetitive coding and UI polishing, the core architecture, the dual-mode logic, and the overall design were entirely planned and built by me. I see AI as a great tool to boost productivity, but the creative direction and code auditing are all human-led.
