## 🚀 Overview

This portfolio is designed to reflect my identity as a **Computer Science Student** specializing in **Cloud Security**. It moves away from the typical "Matrix Hacker" clichés and instead focuses on a clean, engineered "Cloud Architect" aesthetic with a tech-forward edge.

### Key Features
*   **Dual Interface**:
    *   **GUI Mode (Default)**: A modern, responsive interface with glassmorphism, glowing tech borders, and smooth animations.
    *   **Cloud Shell (Hidden)**: A functional CLI environment accessible via a backdoor (`?dev=true`), simulating a cloud terminal.
*   **Interactive Elements**:
    *   **Background**: A custom Canvas-based "Network Graph" simulating connected cloud nodes.
    *   **Typing Animation**: Dynamic hero text cycling through my roles.
    *   **Animated Skills**: Progress bars that trigger on scroll using Intersection Observer.
*   **Tech Stack**: Built with **Vanilla JavaScript** and **Vite** for maximum performance and zero bloat.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

*   **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3 (Variables + Flexbox/Grid), Vanilla ES6+ JavaScript.
*   **Build Tool**: Vite.
*   **Styling**: Custom CSS with a "Cyber-Cloud" theme (Deep Slate Blue & Cyan).
*   **Animation**: Native CSS Transitions & Canvas API.
